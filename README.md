  RhinoAuth
</h1>

RhinoAuth is a simple cloud native OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect server (and a work in progress). Please note that this is not a library, but a final product. Since different projects need different identity management features, this project cannot satisfy everyone. But, at least I hope it can be used as a starting template.

Also please note that this project needs external services such as Captcha, email sender, SMS sender, etc. which are not implemented with any real provider and only a development implementation is available.

## Limitations and known issues

Only the `code` OpenID Connect flow is supported to follow OAuth 2.1. It is possible that OpenID Connect will remove the `implicit` and `hybrid` flows in a future updated spec.

Currently only ECDSA JSON Web Key (JWK) is supported, because it is superior to RSA. However, according to specs, supporting RSA is mandatory.

Currently the following OpenID Connect Core parameters are not recognized:

- display
- prompt
- max_age
- ui_locales
- id_token_hint
- login_hint
- acr_values

Out of all of these parameters, the `prompt` is really useful, because clients can check users' auth state and they can make users reenter their password for sensitive operations. It's unfortunate that the OIDC spec merged this concept with the authorization flow, because it makes the flow even more complicated than it already is. In my opinion it should have been a separate endpoint and flow.

According to OAuth, generating a refresh token is optional and up to the server. According to OpenID Connect, generating a refresh token depends on the `offline_access` scope and if persent, a consent page must be shown.
Currently a refresh token will always be generated and `offline_access` will not be processed, which is acceptable for 1st-party clients.


## Missing features (apart from incomplete ones)

- Admin endpoints and Admin UI
- Public client registration endpoint and UI
- User management APIs for native app clients
- Multi-factor authentication (ideally TOTP)
- Publishing events to a message broker
- Documentation
